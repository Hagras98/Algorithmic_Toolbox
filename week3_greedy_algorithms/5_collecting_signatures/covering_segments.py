#Problem Introduction#
#You are responsible for collecting signatures from all tenants of a certain building. For each tenant, you know a period of time when he or she is at home. You would like to collect all signatures by visiting the building as few times as possible. The mathematical model for this problem is the following. You are given a set of segments on a line and your goal is to mark as few points on a line as possible so that each segment contains at least one marked point.

#Problem Description#
#Task: Given a set of 𝑛 segments {[𝑎0, 𝑏0], [𝑎1, 𝑏1], . . . , [𝑎𝑛−1, 𝑏𝑛−1]} with integer coordinates on a line, find the minimum number 𝑚 of points such that each segment contains at least one point. That is, find a set of integers 𝑋 of the minimum size such that for any segment [𝑎𝑖, 𝑏𝑖] there is a point 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 such that 𝑎𝑖 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 𝑏𝑖. 
#Input Format: The first line of the input contains the number 𝑛 of segments. Each of the following 𝑛 lines contains two integers 𝑎𝑖 and 𝑏𝑖 (separated by a space) defining the coordinates of endpoints of the 𝑖-th segment.
#Constraints: 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 100; 0 ≤ 𝑎𝑖 ≤ 𝑏𝑖 ≤ 109 for all 0 ≤ 𝑖 < 𝑛.
#Output Format: Output the minimum number 𝑚 of points on the first line and the integer coordinates of 𝑚 points (separated by spaces) on the second line. You can output the points in any order. If there are many such sets of points, you can output any set. (It is not difficult to see that there always exist a set of points of the minimum size such that all the coordinates of the points are integers.)
